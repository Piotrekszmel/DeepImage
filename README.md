# DeepImage

Deep Learning Image transformation API. For now only neural style transfer is implemented. It's using pre-trained model.

### Stylize Images Using Pre-trained Multi-Style Generative Network

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Piotrekszmel/DeepImage.git
    cd DeepImage
    ```

2. Download the pre-trained model

    ```bash
    bash scripts/download_model.sh
    ```

3. Run the app

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

Examples:
<img src ="images/1.jpg" width="260px" />
